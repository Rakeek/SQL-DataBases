# SQL-DataBases

This repository contains two sample databases that I created to practice SQL skills and explore database management concepts. Each database is focused on a unique dataset:

1. **TV Show Database** -- project 1 - TV Show DB.sql
2. **Vehicle Database**

## TV Show Database

The **TV Show Database** contains information related to TV shows, including details like show titles, genres, seasons, and ratings.
