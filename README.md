# SQL-DataBases

This repository contains two sample databases that I created to practice SQL skills and explore database management concepts. Each database is focused on a unique dataset:

1. **TV Show Database** -- project 1 - TV Show DB.sql
2. **Vehicle Database** -- project 2 - Vehicle DB.sql
   
## TV Show Database

The **TV Show Database** contains information related to TV shows, including details like show titles, genres, seasons, and ratings.

## Vehicle Database

The Vehicle Database stores data about vehicles, including make, model, year, and type.

This provides an overview of the databases, sample SQL code, and a couple of example queries that showcase the functionality. Let me know if youâ€™d like additional customization!
